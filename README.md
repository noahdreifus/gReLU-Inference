# gReLU-Inference-to-Predict-RNA-seq-Coverage
This project uses the Borzoi model from gReLU to predict RNA-seq coverage tracks given a DNA genomic sequence. gReLU is a Python library to train, interpret, and apply deep learning models to DNA sequences. Borzoi is one of the pre-trained models from the model zoo that uses a convolutional neural network to predict RNA-seq coverage given 524kb input sequences.
